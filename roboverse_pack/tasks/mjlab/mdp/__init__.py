"""Mjlab MDP function library ported to RoboVerse.

These functions are the term implementations used by mjlab task configs
(``mjlab/src/mjlab/tasks/{cartpole,velocity,tracking,manipulation}/``).
They are adapted to RoboVerse's ``ManagerBasedRVEnv`` calling convention:

  - mjlab signature:  ``func(env, **params)``   (reads ``env.scene["robot"].data``)
  - port signature:   ``func(env, env_states, **params)``  (reads ``env_states.robots[...]``)

The ``SceneEntityCfg`` adapter is a minimal port — entity name plus
joint/body name selectors, resolved against the simulator handler's
sorted joint/body ordering at first call.

Phase 2a scope (cartpole minimum):
  observations.joint_pos_rel, .joint_vel_rel, .pole_angle_cos_sin, .last_action
  rewards.cartpole_smooth_reward, ._gaussian_tolerance, ._quadratic_tolerance
  terminations.time_out
  events.reset_joints_by_offset

Future phases will add velocity / tracking / manipulation terms here as
each task is ported.
