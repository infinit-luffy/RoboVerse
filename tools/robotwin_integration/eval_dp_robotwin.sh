# One-command closed-loop DP eval in native RoboTwin (the RoboTwin "eval.sh" experience).
#
# Hides the two-env server/client split: starts dp_policy_server.py in the roboverse
# env (loads the ckpt + serves inference), waits for it to listen, runs
# eval_robotwin_policy.py --policy dp in the robotwin env for N seeds, prints the
# success rate, and tears the server down. A RoboVerse user just points at a
# checkpoint and a task and gets a success rate -- exactly like running RoboTwin's
# own policy eval.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tools/robotwin_integration/eval_dp_robotwin.sh \
#       --task beat_block_hammer \
#       --ckpt il_outputs/ddpm_unet/beat_block_hammer/checkpoints/300.ckpt \
#       --num-eval 20 --start-seed 100
