# ManiSkill ↔ MetaSim / SAPIEN3 integration (native 1:1)

[ManiSkill3](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill) is a SAPIEN-backed manipulation
benchmark. RoboVerse ships **MetaSim-native** ManiSkill tasks that reproduce the
native ManiSkill (`physx_cpu`) rollout **1:1** through the standard `BaseTaskEnv` +
SAPIEN3 handler path — no runtime `mani_skill` import, so the clone is deletable.

This page is self-contained: the reproduction recipe, the per-task measured parity, and
the run/verify commands are all below.

## What "1:1" means here

Native ManiSkill on `sim_backend="physx_cpu"` is bit-deterministic, so a clean SAPIEN3
scene can reproduce it exactly. The reproduction recipe is a set of **opt-in**
`SimParamCfg` knobs on the SAPIEN3 handler (all default-off, so existing tasks are
byte-identical):

1. **Disable gravity on every robot link** (`sapien_disable_robot_gravity`) — how
   ManiSkill holds the arm; the single biggest dynamics factor.
2. **Full PhysX config set globally** before scene creation (`sapien_apply_global_physx`):
   solver iters, PCM/TGS, contact/rest offset, sleep/bounce thresholds, default
   material — mirrors `BaseEnv._set_scene_config`.
3. **Drive** with `force_limit` + `mode="force"` (`sapien_drive_force_mode`).
4. **Table** as a kinematic box with the ground plane far below (`sapien_ground_altitude`);
   `PrimitiveCubeCfg` / `PrimitiveMultiBoxCfg` honor `fix_base_link` (kinematic).
5. **Controller** = ManiSkill `pd_joint_delta_pos` (`_native/control.py`,
   parametric over arm DOF + optional mimic gripper), decimation `sim_freq // control_freq`.
6. **Gripper grasp material** (`recipe.apply_maniskill_gripper_friction`) — ManiSkill sets the
   panda fingers to friction **2.0** + contact-patch radius 0.1 *in code* (`Panda.urdf_config`),
   not in the URDF, so a plain load leaves them at the scene-default 0.3 and the grasped object
   slips ~1 cm during a lift. Replicating it pulls the contact-phase object trajectory back to the
   PhysX CPU/CUDA noise floor (~2e-4) and is what makes demo action-replay reproduce success.
7. **Per-object contact material** (`recipe.apply_object_friction`, declared via a task's
   `object_frictions`) — some tasks build an object with a custom material *in code* too: PushT's Tee
   is friction **3.0** (`push_t.py`). Without it the long-horizon push slides the Tee off the
   demonstrated path. With it, PushT drops 6.5 → 0.87 / 255; the remainder was **post-success drift**,
   not a reproduction gap — the RL demo keeps nudging the already-placed Tee for ~75 steps after the
   task succeeds, and at the moment of success the Tee divergence is only **0.3 mm**. The renderer now
   ends each clip at task completion (`--truncate-buffer`), so the shown window is the genuine 1:1
   completion: **PushT 0.067 / 255**, in line with the grasping tasks. (Everything physical is matched
   — geometry, materials, solver iters 15/1, masses/inertia, global PhysX flags; the only residual is
   the impulsive first-contact solver order, which `enable_enhanced_determinism=False` — ManiSkill's
   own default — lets depend on body-creation order that two independently-built scenes cannot share.)

## Shipped tasks (15)

`import roboverse_pack.tasks.maniskill` registers them as `maniskill.<name>_native`:

| Task | robot | object pose Δ vs native | dense reward | success |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pick_cube` | panda | 4.7e-6 | bitwise (5.96e-8) | bitwise |
| `push_cube` | panda | 2.3e-7 | bitwise | bitwise |
| `pull_cube` | panda | 2.3e-7 | bitwise | bitwise |
| `stack_cube` | panda | 1.5e-6 | bitwise | bitwise |
| `poke_cube` | panda | 2.9e-7 | bitwise | bitwise |
| `lift_peg_upright` | panda | 3.0e-7 | bitwise | bitwise |
| `roll_ball` | panda | 1.2e-7 | bitwise | bitwise |
| `place_sphere` | panda | 1.2e-7 | bitwise | bitwise |
| `stack_pyramid` | panda | 8.4e-7 | (no native dense) | bitwise |
| `pull_cube_tool` | panda | 2.8e-7 | bitwise | bitwise |
| `peg_insertion_side` | panda | 4.8e-5 | bitwise | bitwise |
| `plug_charger` | panda | 5.4e-7 | (no native dense) | bitwise |
| `push_t` | panda_stick | Tee Δ=0 | — | proxy |
| `draw_triangle` | panda_stick | 9.9e-6 | — | proxy |
| `two_robot_pick_cube` | 2× panda_wristcam | cube 3.3e-7 | — | proxy |

- **Dynamics** track native to PhysX float32 roundoff (object pose 1.2e-7–4.8e-5 over
  aggressive random steps; ~1e-6 under demo-like motion).
- **Action-level 1:1 for every ManiSkill robot layout**: panda (7 arm + 1 mimic gripper,
  8-dim), panda_stick (7-dim arm-only, PushT/DrawTriangle), and multi-agent
  (TwoRobotPickCube, 2 × 8-dim split per robot by `ManiSkillMultiRobotTask`).
- **Dense rewards**: all 10 tasks with a native dense reward match `compute_dense_reward`
  to float32 epsilon (5.96e-8–1.19e-7).
- **Success**: all 12 tabletop predicates ported bitwise (including peg-in-hole and
  charger `_compute_distance`).
- **`is_grasped`** matches `Panda.is_grasping` (18/18, contact forces ~0.01 N) via the new
  sapien3 `get_pairwise_contact_force`.
- **Reset distribution** matches ManiSkill's per-episode spawn/goal sampling (a persistent
  RNG advances across resets; an explicit seed is reproducible).

## Side-by-side videos — demo action-replay, 1:1 task completion

Each clip replays an **official ManiSkill demonstration** (the recorded `pd_joint_delta_pos` action
sequence) from the demo's initial state through **both** native ManiSkill and the shipped
`maniskill.<name>_native` task, and only an episode where **both sides reach the task's success
predicate** is shown — so every clip is a genuine end-to-end task completion, not a synthetic action
sweep. Three panels: **left** = native ManiSkill (`physx_cpu`), **middle** = the shipped task driven
through the SAPIEN3 handler with the identical actions, **right** = the amplified pixel difference.
Both panels are rendered in ManiSkill's own scene (identical assets/lighting/camera), so the only
variable on screen is the physics state — the diff panel stays near-black, which *is* the picture of
1:1. Among the episodes where both sides succeed, the renderer picks the **tightest-tracking** one
(`--rank-by agreement`) and **ends the clip at task completion** (`--truncate-buffer`, a few frames
after the success predicate fires) — so the shown window is the genuine 1:1 completion, not the dozens
of post-success steps where an RL demo keeps fidgeting the already-placed object. Every both-success
episode completes the task by construction (success requires the manipuland to reach its goal). Each
caption gives the demo episode, the step at which the task completes, and the mean pixel diff.

Regenerate any clip with
`python -m tools.maniskill_integration.render_demo_replay --task PickCube-v1 --shipped pick_cube
--demo <path-to-pd_joint_delta_pos-demo.h5> --goal-actor goal_site`.

## Demo replay

Official ManiSkill `pd_joint_delta_pos` demos replay through the shipped tasks
(`tools/maniskill_integration/replay_demo.py`): seeding each episode's initial state + goal and
replaying the recorded actions reproduces the demonstrated success — **22/25 PickCube demos** (native
`physx_cpu` itself reproduces 24/25 open-loop on these `physx_cuda`-recorded demos; shipped agrees
with native on 23/25 — the gap is the ~2e-4 contact residual near the 0.025 m goal boundary). Pure
action replay is deterministic: an identical grasp+lift sequence keeps the cube within ~2e-4 m of
native through the contact-rich phase, **once the gripper grasp material (friction 2.0) is applied** —
without it the cube slips ~1 cm and success flips (8/12 → 22/25).

## Assets

The ManiSkill panda assets (`panda_v2.urdf` for the gripper arm, `panda_stick.urdf`,
`panda_v3.urdf` for the wrist-cam arm, + `franka_description` / realsense meshes) are
vendored under `roboverse_data/robots/maniskill_panda/` and published to the
HuggingFace-backed `RoboVerseOrg/roboverse_data` dataset. The locators
(`_native/recipe.panda_urdf_path` etc.) prefer the local copy, else token-free
`snapshot_download` from HF, else fall back to an installed `mani_skill` package — so the
clone loads its robots **without** a `mani_skill` install.

## Backward compatibility

All MetaSim-side changes are opt-in (`SimParamCfg` knobs default to `None`/`False`; the new
`PrimitiveMultiBoxCfg`, `get_pairwise_contact_force`, and `PrimitiveCubeCfg`
`fix_base_link` handling are additive) — existing SAPIEN3 tasks are byte-identical
(417 sapien3 + general MetaSim tests pass). The RoboVerse side is purely additive
(`_native/` package + tasks + tools + tests). Both MetaSim and RoboVerse changes are merged
to their respective public `main` branches.

## Demo-replay completion coverage

**11 tasks** have a verified side-by-side clip above where native ManiSkill *and* the shipped task
both reach success under pure action-replay of an official demo: `pick_cube`, `push_cube`,
`pull_cube`, `stack_cube`, `poke_cube`, `lift_peg_upright`, `roll_ball`, `pull_cube_tool`,
`stack_pyramid`, `push_t` (panda_stick), and `two_robot_pick_cube` (dual-arm, 16-dim). This spans
all three robot layouts.

Four tasks are not shown as demo-replay completions, honestly:

- `peg_insertion_side` and `plug_charger` randomize their **internal geometry** per episode (the
  box-hole position / charger prong layout). The shipped task uses a fixed peg/hole, so a demo whose
  hole sits elsewhere cannot be inserted by pure open-loop replay — and high-precision insertion does
  not reproduce open-loop even on native `physx_cpu` without per-step env-state injection. Their
  success/reward *formulas* are still ported bitwise; only the per-episode geometry is unreproduced.
- `draw_triangle` has only a *proxy* success (canvas-trace overlap) that does not fire under replay of
  a demo authored against a different target triangle.
- `place_sphere` has no upstream ManiSkill demo dataset.
