"""Backend-free conformance guardrail: every Tier-1 task ``reset`` accepts ``seed``.

The gym bridge (``metasim.task.gym_registration``) forwards ``env.reset(seed=)``
to a task only when the task's ``reset`` signature accepts it — tasks that
override ``reset`` without a ``seed`` parameter silently drop the seed, so
rollouts are not reproducible on the simulator side.

This test statically (no sim backend, no instantiation) scans every task file
and asserts the contract on **Tier-1 tasks only**:

* **Tier 1** — classes in the unified contract: they (transitively) subclass
  ``BaseTaskEnv`` / ``RLTaskEnv`` / ``ManagerBasedRVEnv``. Only these are checked.
* **Tier 3** — external/native passthrough adapters under dedicated ``_native``/
  ``_passthrough`` paths are an explicitly-exempt compatibility tier and skipped.
  (Exemption is PATH-based only — a first-party in-contract task is checked even
  if its class name starts with ``Native``; see ``_is_tier3``.)
* Non-task helpers (controllers, sensors, command/actuator managers, success
  evaluators, sessions) are not in the inheritance graph to ``BaseTaskEnv`` and
  are therefore ignored.

Assertions (ratchets — each allowlist may only SHRINK, and may not go stale):

* ``reset`` — no *new* Tier-1 override drops ``seed`` (allowlist now empty →
  zero-tolerance); the unified family base classes honor the contract.
* ``step`` — no *new* Tier-1 override (action transforms belong in a pre-physics
  action hook / ``pre_physics_step_callback``); current overrides are tracked
  in ``KNOWN_STEP_OVERRIDES`` as P1-cleanup targets.
* ``close`` — no *new* Tier-1 override (teardown belongs in ``close_callback``).

When you fix a file (accept ``seed`` / drop the ``step``/``close`` override),
delete it from the corresponding allowlist below.
