## [1.0.0-beta] - 2026-05-31

The headline of this release is **cross-platform parity is now testable and
load-bearing**. Every shipped `RobotCfg`, every contracted handler method,
and every benchmark `reset(seed=N)` is exercised across the supported
backends and either passes or is xfail-documented with a specific reason.

The release is forward- and backward-compatible.

### Added

- **`tests/test_roboverse_robot_cfg_validation.py`** — validates every
  `RobotCfg` shipped in `roboverse_pack`: instantiation, non-empty `name`,
  default joint positions inside `joint_limits` ranges. 60 cfgs × 4 checks,
  9 real downstream bugs surfaced and xfail-documented:
  - `AlohaAgilex`, `G1Tracking` — orphan joints in `default_joint_positions`
  - `YamCfg`, `ArxL5Cfg`, `Vega`, `SoArm100`, `Koch`, `Go2`, `AllegroHand` —
    defaults outside `joint_limits` ranges
- **IL + RL fusion bridge** (`roboverse_learn/fusion/`) — RL-trained policy
  → demo collection (rollout → `save_demo` → `data2zarr` unchanged) +
  IL-to-RL BC warmstart. End-to-end pipeline orchestrator
  (`rl-train → collect → to-zarr → il-train`). 6/6 tests; validated against
  a real cartpole checkpoint and real mujoco/EGL launch. Fails fast on
  scene-MJCF tasks where robot is not a `RobotCfg`.
- **mjlab 1:1 obs/reward parity** — extensive byte-level alignment work:
  - `TerrainGridScanSensor` + `height_scan` obs wired into
    `velocity_rough_go1` / `velocity_rough_g1` (1:1 building block).
  - Continuous rough terrain wired into both velocity-rough quadruped
    tasks.
  - `tracking-g1` motion-tracking obs ports `motion_anchor` + `robot_body`
    1:1.
  - `lift_cube_yam` regains the missing `ee_to_cube` + `cube_to_goal` obs.
  - `velocity_rough` height_scan is now correctly scaled by
    `1 / max_distance` (matches mjlab); clip-then-scale order on the obs
    term matches mjlab's `noise → clip → scale`.
  - go1 / g1 `base_lin_vel` obs reads the IMU velocimeter at the offset
    site (adds the `ω × r` cross-term — fixes a real obs gap that diverged
    under turning).
  - cross-sim cartpole eval pipeline repaired (actor build, device,
    episode metric).
- **RoboTwin v2 passthrough** — 50 RoboTwin tasks registered as native gym
  envs (`RoboVerse/RoboTwin-<task>-v0`), 1:1 by construction, mirrors the
  ManiSkill passthrough pattern.
- **`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`** — repo-level dev rules for AI agents
  (double quote, line-length 120, py38 target, lazy imports OK,
  parity-is-load-bearing, multi-repo discipline, commit-as-user).

### Fixed

- **`get_started/0_static_scene.py`** — gracefully skips the cameras-empty
  case instead of crashing on first-time setup.
- **mjlab tooling paths** — lint-clean across mjlab/maniskill tasks;
  tooling paths made portable (no hardcoded `/home/ghr/...`).
- **mjlab MJCF asset resolution** — assets pulled from
  `RoboVerseOrg/roboverse_data` on Hugging Face instead of hardcoded local
  paths (fresh checkout no longer breaks). Dual-mode locator
  `_locator.mjlab_asset` = clone-or-HF.
- **mjlab go1 Newton 1:1** — go1 RL now stands on Newton (PD actuators +
  init pose + action order alignment).

### Documentation

- `ROADMAP.md` — P0/P1 cross-platform infra items marked fixed; P2/P3
  items refreshed.
- mjlab / maniskill / robotwin integration pages wired into the docs
  toctree.

### Tests

- 60 RoboVerse `RobotCfg` configs validated × 4 checks = 240 statically
  exercised; 9 real bugs xfail-documented.
- Cross-4-backend sweep against MetaSim core in the `roboverse` conda env:
  mujoco + sapien3 + newton + passthroughs — 323 passed, 0 regressions.

### Migration

No code changes are required for existing users.

If you maintain an out-of-tree `RobotCfg`, the new validation test will
exercise it as soon as it is imported through `roboverse_pack` — fix any
flagged `default_joint_positions` mismatches before they trip in CI.
