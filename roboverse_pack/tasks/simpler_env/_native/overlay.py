"""Visual-matching (greenscreen) overlay — vendored from SimplerEnv, pixel-exact.

SimplerEnv's "visual matching" eval composites a real-world inpainted photo behind the
simulated robot+object: background pixels are replaced by the overlay image while the
foreground (robot links, target objects, other articulation links) stays sim-rendered.
The mask comes from the actor-level segmentation channel.

This reproduces ``mani_skill2_real2sim/envs/custom_scenes/base_env.py::get_obs`` (the
greenscreen block, lines ~349-399 @ ef7a4d4) exactly, as a standalone pure-numpy/cv2
function with NO dependency on the upstream package — so the native port can do
visual-matching without ``mani_skill2_real2sim``. Deterministic: given identical render +
segmentation it is bit-for-bit identical to upstream.
