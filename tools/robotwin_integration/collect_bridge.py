"""Collect one successful RoboTwin episode as a sim-agnostic bimanual trajectory.

This is the *RoboTwin-side* half of the RoboVerse data bridge. It must run in
the dedicated ``robotwin`` conda env (sapien 3.0.0b1 / mplib / curobo), NOT the
``roboverse`` env -- their sapien/torch builds conflict. It drives a native
RoboTwin task through the same passthrough factory RoboVerse exposes
(``roboverse_pack.tasks.robotwin._passthrough``), retries seeds until one plans
*and* checks successfully (mirroring RoboTwin's ``collect_data.py`` loop), then
dumps the dense dual-arm joint trajectory plus initial object poses to a plain
pickle.

The companion ``get_started/10_robotwin_aloha_replay.py`` then runs in the
``roboverse`` env: it converts that pickle into RoboVerse's name-keyed ``*_v2``
format and replays the ALOHA-AgileX embodiment. Keeping the hand-off a plain
pickle of numpy arrays is what lets the two incompatible envs cooperate.

Example::

    conda run -n robotwin env MUJOCO_GL=egl python \\
        tools/robotwin_integration/collect_bridge.py --task beat_block_hammer \\
        --out ~/projects/robotwin/data/_rv_bridge/beat_block_hammer.pkl
